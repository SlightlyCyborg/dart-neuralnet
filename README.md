# Dart Neural Net
## Backprop

## Installation
Git clone the library and run the handwriting example by running example/handwriting.dart. Also you could open up index.html in web to see the WebGL graphical representation of the net (this is still in development).

## Contribution
If you want to contribute, which I know you want to, it would be cool to have more examples!!
