#Dart Neural Net#
## Backprop me baby, because I've got a dart and I'm throwing it at ya ##

##Installation##
Git clone the library and run the handwriting example by running example/handwriting.dart. Also you could open up index.html in web to see the WebGL graphical representation of the net (this is still in development).

If you want to contribute, which I know you want to, it would be cool to have more examples!!
